Recommender systems are used to predict the "rating" or "preference" that a user would give to an item. In this project we will be building a recommender system for movies. Recommender systems can be classified into 3 types:
1. Simple recommender- this offer generalized recommendations to every user based on movie popularity and/or genre.
2. Content-based recommenders- suggest similar items based on a particular item. The system uses item metadata such as director, description, actors.

3.Collaborative filtering engines- these try to predict the rating or preference that a user would give an item-based on past ratings.
